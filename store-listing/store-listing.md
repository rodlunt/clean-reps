## Full Description

Clean Reps exists because fitness apps have become too complicated.

No social feeds. No AI meal plans. No badges, streaks, or motivational quotes. Just a simple way to remember what weight you lifted last week.

Clean Reps does one thing: tracks your workouts. That's it.

**The basics:**

• Log your sets, reps, and weights
• Build routines that match how you train
• View your workout history

**Multiple gym setups**

Got a home gym and a work gym? Travelling and stuck with hotel equipment? Set up different gym profiles with the equipment available at each location. The app filters exercises based on what's actually there - no more scrolling past cable machines when all you've got is dumbbells.

**Track what matters**

• Personal records get flagged automatically
• Estimated 1RM charts show strength gains over time
• Weekly volume stats to see if you're putting in work
• 4-week trend view to spot progress or plateaus

**Smart scheduling**

The app remembers where you're at in your routine. Open it up, and it knows you're on Push Day or Leg Day or whatever's next. Missed a few days? Skip ahead to any day.

**Works how you want**

• kg or lbs - your choice
• Dark mode for early mornings
• Works completely offline - no wifi at the gym? No problem

**What's NOT included:**

• No accounts or sign-ups
• No subscriptions or premium tiers
• No ads, ever
• No social features or sharing
• No "upgrade to unlock" nonsense
• No data collection

Everything works from day one. Nothing to unlock, nothing to pay for, nothing trying to keep you scrolling.

All workout data stays on your device. There are no servers, no user databases, no analytics. This app was built for people who just want to track their lifts and get on with their day.

Open the app. Log your workout. Close the app. Done.
